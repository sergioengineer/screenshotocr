A simple gtk application used to copy text from screenshots that I use in order to copy code and text blocks from the videos that I watch.

Requires [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html):
```
    sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
    sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
```
